# Road Freight Transport in Latvia: Analysis of Volume & Fuel Consumption (2014–2023)

This project analyses road freight transport trends in Latvia over a ten‑year period (2014–2023), focusing on freight volume and fuel consumption. By examining official statistics and reports, the study uncovers correlations between freight activity, fuel usage, and broader economic conditions.

## Objectives

- Collect and organize data on freight transport volume and fuel consumption in Latvia.
- Identify trends and seasonal patterns in freight movement and energy use.
- Compare road freight with other transportation modes (rail, maritime) to contextualize findings.
- Provide data‑driven recommendations for logistics companies and policymakers.

## Data & Methodology

- **Sources:** Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia, Latvian Public Broadcasting reports, EU transport statistics, and academic literature.
- **Tools:** Spreadsheet analysis (Excel), descriptive statistics, trend analysis, correlation plots, and a narrative report.
- **Approach:** Historical time series analysis of freight volumes and fuel consumption, supplemented by qualitative insights on regulatory and infrastructural factors.

## Key Insights

- Road freight demand in Latvia increased steadily from 2014‑2019, followed by fluctuations due to pandemic‑related disruptions.
- Fuel consumption mirrored freight volume trends but exhibited sharper peaks, indicating variations in fuel efficiency and routing.
- Comparisons with rail transport highlight opportunities for modal shift to reduce emissions and congestion.
- EU regulatory changes and infrastructure investments significantly influence freight patterns and fuel usage.

## Deliverables

- **Report:** [`RA3.docx`](./RA3.docx) – a narrative document outlining the analysis, data tables, charts, and recommendations.
- **Presentation:** `Evaluation Road Freight Transport and fuel ...` – a slide deck summarising the study for stakeholder presentations.
- **Documentation:** `README.md` (this file) – overview of the project, methods, insights, and skills demonstrated.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Sourcing and organizing multi‑year transport and fuel datasets.
- **Trend Analysis:** Applying time series techniques to identify patterns and anomalies.
- **Comparative Evaluation:** Assessing road freight against other transport modes and contextual factors.
- **Report Writing:** Communicating technical findings in an accessible format for both technical and non‑technical audiences.

## How to Use

This repository serves as a portfolio piece illustrating my ability to conduct end‑to‑end transport analytics. Review the report and presentation to see the full analysis and conclusions. Feel free to adapt the methodology for similar studies in other countries or sectors.
